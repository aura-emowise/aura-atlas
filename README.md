AURA:  Neuro-Geographic Atlas

Tagline: Visualizing the collective mind for a better world and a better self.

üöÄ About the Project
AURA is an innovative software platform, created as part of the Google Maps Platform hackathon. For the first time in the world, it visualizes the collective psycho-emotional state of the population in real-time, transforming a standard map into a living, breathing "neuro-geographic atlas."

The project is based on the concept outlined in the patent by inventor Aleksandr Prokofev: "Google Cloud Mind and Generalized Cognitive Mapping (GCM)". AURA aggregates billions of anonymized biometric signals from users of wellness applications (such as EmoWise) to create an "emotional climate" map of cities and regions.

Our goal is to make the invisible landscape of stress, calm, productivity, and well-being visible and useful for citizens, businesses, and urban authorities.

‚ú® Key Features
This interactive web application demonstrates the core functionality of the AURA platform:

üå°Ô∏è "Emotional Climate" Layer: A dynamic heatmap showing zones of stress (red) and calm (green) in a city.

üìç Neuro-Emotional POIs: Interactive points of interest where clicking provides a detailed AI analysis of their "emotional profile" using the Gemini API.

üçÉ Cognitive Navigation: The ability to plot not just the fastest, but also the "calmest" route, avoiding high-stress areas.

üå¨Ô∏è Environmental Analysis: Integration with the Air Quality API to assess air quality and receive AI-powered health recommendations.

ü§ù Eco-Emotional Synthesis: A unique feature using the Gemini API to analyze the link between air quality and the collective mood in an area.

üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Activity Simulation: An interactive walking simulation to demonstrate how physical activity can be analyzed in the context of the environment.

üèôÔ∏è Immersive 3D View: A demonstration of the concept of visualizing data in a three-dimensional space.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
The project is built using modern web technologies and powerful APIs from Google.

Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
Mapping and Geolocation: Google Maps Platform
APIs: Maps JavaScript API, Places API, Directions API, Visualization Library
Environmental Data: Air Quality API
Artificial Intelligence: Gemini API (for generating insights and analytics)
Icons: Phosphor Icons

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Demo
The application is a single index.html file and does not require complex setup.
Download the file: Save the application code as index.html.
Get API Keys: For full functionality, you will need API keys from the Google Cloud Platform. Ensure the following APIs are enabled for your project:
Maps JavaScript API
Places API
Directions API
Air Quality API
Generative Language API
Insert the keys into the code: Open the index.html file in a text editor and find the API keys section within the <script> tag. Insert your keys into the corresponding variables: mapsApiKey, airQualityApiKey, and geminiApiKey.
Open in a browser: Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
Important: Make sure that a Billing Account is enabled for your project in the Google Cloud Console. This is a necessary requirement for the APIs to work, even within the free tiers.

Visionary: Aleksandr Prokofev

This project is a practical implementation of the ideas embedded in the concepts of EmoWise, GCM, and Cognitive Sovereignty. It demonstrates how technology can help us not only navigate the physical world but also better understand and shape our internal and collective mental landscape.
